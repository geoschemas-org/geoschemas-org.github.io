Geoschemas.org started as part of the [NSF EarthCube](https://earthcube.org) initiative to mobilize NSF data facilities to publish self-describing information about their organization, services and data holdings.

For guidelines on publishing schema.org for describing a Data Repository or Datasets, see [Github: science-on-schema.org](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org)
